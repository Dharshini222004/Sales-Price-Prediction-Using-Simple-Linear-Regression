# *SALES PRICE PREDICTION*

# *Objective*:
- *Develop a machine learning model to predict sales prices with high accuracy using linear regression*.

# *Dataset Analysis*:
- *Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis. Identified key features and the target variable (sales price) for prediction*.

# *Data Splitting*:
- *Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using Scikit-learn's train_test_split method. Ensured that the split maintains data variability for reliable model training and testing*.

# *Machine Learning Algorithm*:
- *Implemented Linear Regression from Scikit-learn as the prediction model. Trained the model on the training set to learn relationships between features and sales price**.

# *Model Evaluation*:
- *Evaluated the model on the testing set using metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE): To measure prediction error. R-squared Score: To evaluate the modelâ€™s goodness-of-fit*.

# *Visualization*:
## *Used Matplotlib to plot*:
- *Actual vs. Predicted sales prices for better interpretability. A regression line showing the model's predictions*.

# *Tools and Libraries*:
- *Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis. Scikit-learn: For data splitting, model building, and evaluation. Matplotlib: For data visualization*.

# *Outcome*:
- *Successfully predicted sales prices with good accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of linear regression for sales data. Provided insights into key factors influencing sales prices*.

# *Future Enhancements*:
- *Incorporate advanced regression techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso). Perform feature engineering and scaling for improved performance. Expand analysis to include additional datasets or features.# simple-_linear_-regression*.
